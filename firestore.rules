/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for HarmonyStream.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and playlists.
 * Tracks are treated as public read-only data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/playlists/{playlistId}: Stores playlists created by each user. Only the user can manage their own playlists.
 * - /tracks/{trackId}: Stores track metadata. This collection is publicly readable, but only writeable by a process outside of the scope of security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user document.
 * - Users can only access playlists under their user document.
 * - Tracks are publicly readable to allow for easy discovery and playback. Write operations are denied.
 * - Listing of users is not allowed to prevent data scraping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Playlists are stored as subcollections under users to easily enforce ownership using path-based rules, avoiding costly `get()` calls.
