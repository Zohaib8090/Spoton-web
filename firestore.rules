/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and playlists. Tracks are globally accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/playlists/{playlistId}: Stores playlists created by each user. Only the owning user can manage their playlists.
 * - /tracks/{trackId}: Stores track metadata. Read access is public, and write access is currently disabled (requires further definition).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Public read access to tracks is allowed, but write access is restricted and requires further implementation based on application requirements.
 *
 * Authorization Independence:
 * - The rules are designed to avoid using `get()` calls to other documents, which simplifies the rules and improves performance.
